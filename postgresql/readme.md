## Why learn PostgreSQL

 * [Cross platform](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
 * Supported by various cloud providers such as
    [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/),
    [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/),
    [Google](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/) Beta!,
    [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), etc.
 * [Good conformance to the SQL:2011 standard](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/features.html).
 * [Extensible](https://pgxn.org/).
 * Reliable.
 * [Economical/good ROI](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/white-papers/economic-and-business-advantages-edb-postgres-database-solutions)
 * It's a rather fun (subjective, I know) database.
 * It appears to have some serious [momentum going for it](popularity.md).
 * It has [cool things](postgresql-rocks.md)
 * It has [issues](postgresql-sucks.md) (o.k. that would be reasons not to use it)

## How/where to learn PostgreSQL

The intent is not to create any kind of exhaustive list of questionable
quality resources or badly date resources but rather to build a small
list of reasonably up-to-date good quality resources.

### Tutorials and training

 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial.html -- This
    is the official tutorial for the current version of PostgreSQL.

 * http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/ -- "Learn PostgreSQL from Scratch"
    (See also http://www.mysqltutorial.org/ and
    http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/ for MySQL and SQLite because knowing
    more than one database is "a good thing".)

 * http://www.sqltutorial.org/ -- Learn SQL. Covers the standard syntax.

 * https://pgexercises.com/ -- Learn SQL ala PostgreSQL by working
    through the various exercises provided. Web based so no local
    PostgreSQL installation is needed.

 * https://github.com/Abstrct/Schemaverse -- Learn PostgreSQL by
    playing a space-based strategy game.

 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkjQSkWl0F0&list=PLFRIKEguV54bgwAcgFiOs5GMo3q2DhVDj
    -- PostgreSQL Database Video Tutorials (a little dated but not bad)

 * https://www.otg-nc.com/postgresql -- Highly recommended. I took
    their PostgreSQL Administration course in 2009 and thought the
    course was quite good.

 * https://www.enterprisedb.com/training/training-and-certification
    -- Have not looked at (yet) but enterprisedb does have a pretty
    good reputation.

### Documentation and books

 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/index.html -- The
    official documentation.

 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/ -- A list of what appears to
    be almost every PostgreSQL book ever written.
